WSIMTEL 2.0 - Simtel/CICA and others index search program for Windows

This program can handle index files from simtel20 (SIMIBM.IDX), cica (INDEX) and
the Simtel20 CD-ROM (INDEX.TXT).  A DBASE III file is created from these files 
and this dbf file can be searched with this program.  All you need is wsimtel
and an index file!!

Fast searches can be done for:
	
	filename
	directory	a listing of the available directories can be shown
	description
	date		from date to date

Output is done with user configurable scripts.
Scripts are included for output to file, printer, clipboard and to AutoFTP
format.

Indexes are imported with import filter dll's.  If you are a programmer you can
write import filters for additional indexes.

This program is free, but registration is encouraged.
